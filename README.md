# ⚡ Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading System using Blockchain

Welcome to the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Energy Trading System, a decentralized application (DApp) built using Blockchain technology to enable secure, transparent, and efficient energy transactions between consumers and prosumers.

# 📌 Overview

This project leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized marketplace where individuals can trade surplus energy without the need for traditional intermediaries. By utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, transactions are automated, secure, and immutable, ensuring fair and transparent energy distribution. This system enhances energy efficiency, promotes renewable energy adoption, and empowers users with greater control over their energy consumption and sales.
